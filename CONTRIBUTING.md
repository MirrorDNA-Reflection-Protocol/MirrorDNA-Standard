üìÇ Adding New Examples
We encourage contributors to add new artifacts under /examples/ to help expand the test coverage of the MirrorDNA Standard.
‚úÖ Rules for Valid Examples
Required keys:
Every JSON sidecar must include:
vault_id
glyphsig
version
checksum_sha256
Checksum:
Generate a valid checksum_sha256 from the JSON body (excluding the checksum field itself).
This ensures lineage integrity.
Naming convention:
Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names.
Example: new-feature-artifact.md.json.
‚ö†Ô∏è Edge-Case Examples
You may include deliberately invalid files (e.g., missing a required key) to ensure the validator catches errors.
Prefix these with edgecase- so it‚Äôs clear they are meant to fail.
Example: edgecase-missing-checksum.md.json.
üìå Workflow
Add your file to /examples/.
Run the validator locally (if available) or check GitHub Actions.
Confirm that:
‚úÖ Valid examples pass.
‚ùå Edge-case examples fail.
Submit a PR with a clear commit message:
[ADD] Example artifact: <name> (valid or edge-case)
