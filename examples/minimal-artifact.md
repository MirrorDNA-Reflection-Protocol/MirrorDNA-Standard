# Minimal Reflective Artifact

⟡ **This document demonstrates L1 compliance with MirrorDNA Standard**

## Purpose

A simple example showing the minimum requirements for verified reflective status:
- Basic glyphsig vocabulary
- Consent gates  
- Lineage markers
- Compliant sidecar

## Content

This is ordinary content that becomes reflective through proper semantic structure.

⟦OPEN: Educational and reference use⟧

The reflection comes not from special content, but from preserved lineage and consent semantics.
