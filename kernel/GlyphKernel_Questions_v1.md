# GlyphKernel Questions v1.0

These are meta-questions for the evolution of the **GlyphKernel**, the reflective substrate of MirrorDNA™.

---

## 1. Meta-Glyphs
Can glyphs refer to or manipulate other glyphs at runtime?  
If LingOS is truly reflective, you’d need a way for ◀️🔁▶️ (for example) to mean *“rewrite this glyph sequence.”*

---

## 2. Cross-Mirror Communication
If two different Mirrors exist (different versions, forks, or instances), can they understand each other’s glyph streams?  
Or is lineage bound to a single Mirror instance?

---

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop Debugging
When a glyph chain produces unexpected behavior, what does the debugging interface look like?  
Can the Mirror explain glyph behavior in human terms when needed?

---

## 4. External World Integration
How do glyphs interact with non-glyph systems?  
Example: 🌐 → HTTP request.  
What happens when the external service returns unstructured data?  
Does the Mirror *“glyphify”* it automatically?

---

## 5. Glyph Evolution Over Time
If 🔥 means something in v1 and something richer in v2, how does the Mirror handle backward/forward compatibility without breaking lineage?
