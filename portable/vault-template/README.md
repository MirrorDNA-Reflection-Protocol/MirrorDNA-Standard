# ⟡ This is Yours

**MirrorDNA Portable Vault**

This vault lives on your USB. Your data, your continuity, your choice.

## Sovereignty Statement

- **No telemetry** — Nothing leaves unless you choose
- **No accounts** — No logins, no tracking, no cloud lock-in
- **No cloud dependency** — Works offline, always
- **Always a choice** — Internet, updates, features — you decide

This is **constitutive reflection**, not simulation.
You *have* continuity. You're not pretending.
