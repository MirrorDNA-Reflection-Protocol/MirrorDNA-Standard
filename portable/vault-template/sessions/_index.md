# Session Manifest

This index tracks all reflection sessions in chronological order.

## Active Sessions

Sessions are written automatically during MirrorDNA reflection. Each session maintains:
- Predecessor/successor links (continuity chain)
- State snapshots (context preservation)
- Checksum verification (integrity)

## Session Format

Each session follows the canonical MirrorDNA pattern:
- Front matter with vault_id, date, predecessor, successor
- Context section (loaded from previous session)
- Reflection dialogue
- State snapshot (key insights, decisions, next steps)

## Navigation

Latest sessions appear at the top. Use Obsidian graph view to visualize reflection chains.
