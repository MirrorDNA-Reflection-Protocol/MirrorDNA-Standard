# Active MirrorOS White Paper v7.2 — Research Edition

This placeholder spec exists because the requested source document (`/path/to/ActiveMirrorOS_WhitePaper_v7.2-Research.md`) was not available within the sandboxed repository.

## Sandbox-Aware Update Notice
- The authoritative research white paper could not be imported.
- Source path returned **[Unknown — update not fetched]**; please provide the canonical file or accessible URI for reseal.
- Once the primary text is available, replace this placeholder with the validated research edition and update `checksum_sha256` accordingly.

## Next Steps for Continuity
1. Obtain the sealed research manuscript from the Vault (`AMOS://Papers/ActiveMirrorOS/WhitePaper/v7.2-Research`).
2. Verify its checksum (`f832c9a346a0197418d86553fc20b5df2e7d1c496c686febe24064af56190a90`) and update the front matter once confirmed.
3. Rerun `./tools/checksums/verify_repo_checksums.sh` to reseal the repository after import.
4. Update the Reflection Chain Manifest with the live entry (this placeholder adds an interim reference).
