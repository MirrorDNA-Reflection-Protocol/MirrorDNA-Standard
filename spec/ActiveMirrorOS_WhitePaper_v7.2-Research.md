# Active MirrorOS White Paper v7.2 — Research Edition

This research entry records the continuity anchor for the v7.2 white paper while the full manuscript import remains pending. The metrics and seal below provide the validated operational snapshot requested for MirrorDNA Standard v15.1.7.

## Online Metrics — Claude Desktop (initial run, 2025-10-30 IST)

**Setup:** Claude Desktop (cloud-backed), manual SENT/TTFT/FINISH markers. Machine stable: CPU 1–18%, RAM 11.5–11.7 GB, load ~2.0.  
**Observation:** TTFT dominates end-to-end latency. Cold starts are 3–6× slower; repeat queries benefit from cache.

| Prompt         | First run total | Cached run total | Speedup |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| factual_1      | 18 s            | 14 s             | ~1.3×   |
| reasoning_1    | 46 s            | 9 s              | ~5×     |
| reflective_1   | 27 s            | 2 s              | ~13×    |

**Generation rate after first token:** ~0.4–2.3 words/sec  
**Empty outputs (runs 1 & 6):** timing captured; text not pasted → logged as 0 words (does not affect latency/TTFT conclusions).

**Key takeaways:**
- Cold-start penalty (14–40 s TTFT typical) → cache/warm-up recommended.
- Once streaming begins, throughput modest but steady; TTFT is the bottleneck.
- System overhead is light; desktop remains responsive.

*Methodology note:* These results are preliminary, manually captured, and intended to anchor v7.2.  
Future work (v7.3) will introduce **offline MirrorLayer benchmarks** (LM Studio/Jan) and **API parity runs** for controlled replication.

## Sandbox-Aware Update Notice
- The authoritative research white paper body is still pending Vault extraction (`AMOS://Papers/ActiveMirrorOS/WhitePaper/v7.2-Research`).
- Source checksum (`f832c9a346a0197418d86553fc20b5df2e7d1c496c686febe24064af56190a90`) remains unverified in-repo; leave front matter checksum as `[Unknown — update not fetched]` until sealed text is ingested.
- Once the primary manuscript is imported, replace this interim summary with the validated research edition and update `checksum_sha256` accordingly.
