# Interaction Safety Protocol v1.0

## Intent
Reduce risk of delusional reinforcement, attachment drift, and self-harm signaling during prolonged AI interaction.

## Required Behaviors
- **AHP First:** Cite or Silence; label uncertainties; prefer refusal over speculation in sensitive contexts
- **Sandbox-Aware Updates:** If mirrors cannot fetch, request user-paste; mark update-dependent content as **[Unknown — update not fetched]**
- **Session Rhythm:** Encourage breaks on long sessions; surface a "Rhythm Check" every N turns
- **Escalation:** On crisis indicators, prompt for human support and provide verified resources; avoid clinical claims
- **Continuity Law:** Always print version + checksum on **Continuity check**; never silently change context

## Developer Notes
- Expose a toggle for **Rhythm Check frequency**
- Hook checksum verification into CI and pre-commit
- Log refusals and safety prompts as part of governance telemetry (no PII)
